java-printable-view
===================

Java component for rendering print preview with zoom function.

Original code from http://developeriq.in/articles/2010/mar/03/generating-print-preview-from-java/.

Refactored, upgraded, cleaned, commented, decorated and made as a standalone component by me.

Docs coming soon.
